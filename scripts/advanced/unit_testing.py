# If you are writing a code which you think will not be used by you or
# anyone else in future, then you can skip this lesson. However, if
# you intend to write a code, which will used by you and others in future
# then you must write tests for your code, so that your code is reliable.
# The purpose of writing tests is **to make sure that the code works and
# will keep on working the way it should work**.
