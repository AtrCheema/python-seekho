This book consists of jupyter notebooks. Each jupyter notebook consists of multiple cells.
Each cell consists of code snippets. The best way to get maximum out of this book is to
follow following two tips

1) Predict the output from a cell before running the cell, then run the cell and see whether
your prediction matches with the output of the cell or not!
   
2) Chnage the contents of the cell and predict the output and then run the cell and compare your
prediction with actual output.
