A boook for python-learners to learn the language by practicing it.

## Purpose
The purpose of this book is to provide the prospective learners a self-taught material 
with executable notebooks. This book can be used as practical code exercises when the 
(python) infrastructure is available. However, the [pdf version](https://python-seekho.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/) 
of it can also be used as ebook.

## Who should read this book
This book is intended for absolute beginners, those who have no knowledge of python.
A very little knowledge of programming can be helpful to the readers. The advanced
python users may find avanced topics within each chapter in this book useful.

## Installation
If you have internet connection, you have two options
    
- Download the ipython notebook of a lesson and upload it on any cloud servers such
      as [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) /[binder](https://mybinder.org/) /[studiolab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/)
    
- click on launch binder button and start running the code, cell by cell.

For offline users; first install python, the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt
file and jupyter. Then the user can run any jupyter notebook which again can be downloaded
all at once from python-seekho.readthedocs.io .

## How to read this book?
This book consists of jupyter notebooks. Each jupyter notebook consists of multiple cells.
Each cell consists of code snippets. The best way to get maximum out of this book is to
follow following two tips

1) Predict the output from a cell before running the cell, then run the cell and see whether
your prediction matches with the output of the cell or not!
   
2) Chnage the contents of the cell and predict the output and then run the cell and compare your
prediction with actual output.
